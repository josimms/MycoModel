# MycoModel

This package outlines a model, which should be used to look at the C and N transfer between trees in a boreal forest.

The model needs the josimms/PRELES model version and josimms/CASSIA model to work as it forms the structure outlined in the photo below.

The full details should be added when the code is finished, but indervidual functions are written in the function help files.
