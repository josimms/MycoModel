\title{
  Uptake Organic
}
\description{
  The organic uptake of N is currently controlled by considering the maximum possible uptake and then this is downsclaed with functions, taking a value between 0 and 1. These functions take the same logic, but not the same form as the PRELES equations.
  
  Basic uptake
  
  \eqn{u(N) = \frac{k N^8}{N_{limit}^8 + N^8}}
  Where N is the concentration of a form of nitrogen, N_limit and k are parameters to control the uptake.
  
  Temperature effect
  
  \eqn{f_{T}(T) = \frac{T+20}{55}}
  Where T is the temperature, 20 and 55 are parameters to control the uptake.
  
  Water effect
  
  \eqn{f_{SWC}(SWC) = \frac{k SWC^8}{0.5^8 + SWC^8}}
  Where SWC is soil water content and 0.5 and k are parameters.
  
  This comes together to make the basic output:
  
  \eqn{u_{actual} = f_T(T)f_{SWC}(SWC)u(N)}.
