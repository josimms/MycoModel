  Fungal Nitrogen Uptake
}
\description{
  This function uses the nitrogen uptake functions for each of the indervidual types of N compiled for the fungae.
  
  The demand is calculated by the decision function, although is currently 1 for all decision functions included. (Meyer, 2010, Franklin, 2014)
  
  Then the output is the N uptake of each of the types of nitrogen calculated in parallel (Meyer, 2010) a then downscaled with the demand function (me).
  
  \eqn{u_{total} = (u_{Org} + u_{NO3} + u_{NH4})*demand}.
  
  Where \eqn{u_{total}} is the total fungal uptake. \eqn{u_{Org}}, \eqn{u_{NO3}} and \eqn{u_{NH4}}, are the fungal uptake of each of the forms of nitrogen. And demand is an input to the function caluclated in the myco_decision function.
